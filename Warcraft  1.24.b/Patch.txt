  creeps from harassing players when they pass by. Added some trees to start

  have been pushed back from common pathing areas.

  pathing areas through the middle.

FEATURES

- A new Neutral Hero, the Goblin Tinker, has been added to the game. For
  further information on this strange new Hero and a listing of his abilities,
  visit http://www.battle.net/war3 .
- The matchmaking system has been significantly updated. New accounts should 
  more quickly begin playing against opponents of equivalent skill level.

  contribute to your clan's ranking on the ladder.

  clan name, tag, ladder ranking, and more.
- Display of channel moderators has changed.
- Ladder information is now more clearly separated in your user profile.
- Free For All (FFA) games are now anonymous. Account names and player levels 
  will no longer be displayed to other participants. Other players will be 
  displayed as "Player X", where X is the number of the player in the game.
- Added an on/off button for the "Alt" formation toggle functionality to the
  Options --> Gameplay menu. The option is "On" by default.
- Added a "Worker Selection" button that appears beneath the construction 
  progress indicator for Night Elf and Orc buildings. This allows Orc and 
  Night Elf players to re-select workers that are currently constructing a 
  building and give them additional way-pointed orders.

  system directories. Doing so will automatically launch the game and load the

FIXES

- Fixed an issue with cargo based structures/units (Entangled Gold Mines, Orc 
  Burrows, Goblin Zeppelins, etc.) which could cause units to get stuck
  inside permanently.
- Fixed a problem where water elementals that died during Mass Teleport were 
  not being properly removed from the game.
- Fixed an issue that caused hit point bars not to show up properly for some 
  teams when viewing replays.
- Fixed an issue that caused the Anti-magic Shell art to display incorrectly 
  on Crypt Fiends after they unburrow.
- Fixed a problem where a Scroll of Town Portal could be wasted if the 
  targeted town hall was destroyed before the spell completed. The Hero now 
  retains the Scroll if the spell doesn't complete.
- Fixed an issue with the Mountain Giant's Taunt that could cause Invisible 
  and Shadowmelded units to improperly attack and reveal themselves when the 
  ability was activated.
- Fixed an issue with the "Observers on Defeat" functionality that caused 
  units not to be displayed on the minimap.
- Fixed a problem with the Pandaren Brewmaster that caused incorrect 
  regeneration of health and mana while his ultimate was active.
- Fixed a problem with Spell Steal and Polymorph that could turn a ground unit
  into a Flying Sheep.
- Fixed an issue that could cause the Web and Ensnare graphics to display 
  improperly.
- Fixed a problem that caused the Inferno stun damage to not be applied to 
  magic-immune units in The Frozen Throne. All ultimates should ignore magic 
  immunity.
- Fixed some spell targeting issues with Resistant Skin. Doom (and possibly 
  other spells) should work the same way as Charm.
- Fixed an issue with Metamorphosis which prevented some Orb effects 
  from working while the Demon Hunter was in his altered form.
- Fixed a problem with the Scroll of Town Portal which did not allow Heroes 
  to regenerate the appropriate hit points and mana while the spell was being 
  cast.
- Fixed the accidentally inflated hit point regeneration rate on the Naga 
  Sea Witch, Beastmaster, Pandaren Brewmaster, and Spell Breaker back to 
  the standard .25 hit points per second.
- Fixed Shockwave's damage radius to 125.
- Fixed Orb items to now cause the proper damage versus air for melee Heroes.
- Fixed an issue with Militia in which units ordered "Back to Work" could 
  change back into Militia when arriving back at the town hall.
- Fixed Breath of Fire's damage area to more accurately represent a cone area 
  of effect, rather than a line.
- Acolytes harvesting from a Haunted Gold Mine with the Entangling Roots buff 
  now register as idle like other peons. 
- Fixed the Blight generated by the Sacrificial Skull such that a 
  non-Undead building placed on top of the Blight will not remove the 
  Blight when it finishes construction.
  Detonate, Dispel Magic, and Disenchant correctly dispel this Blight.
- Fixed an issue that allowed Banished worker units to build, Repair, 
  and harvest. Note that Detonate and Unsummon will remain unaffected by 
  Banish since they're considered "magical".
- Fixed Lightning Shield so that if two units with Lightning Shields overlap 
  each other, they both correctly take damage.
- Fixed an issue that allowed an ally that did not have Shared Control to 
  Uproot and command your Ancient of Wonders. Allied players without Shared 
  Control should only be able to purchase items from the building.
- Fixed a problem with item-summoned units which would cause them to leave 
  corpses and spawn units from Black Arrow.
- Fixed an issue with Animate Dead which in some cases caused the spell to
  transfer the unit upgrades to the new owner.
- Fixed an issue that prevented players from way-pointing the Faerie 
  Dragon's Mana Flare ability.

MAPS

Expansion - Frozen Throne
- (2)Tirisfal Glades - Added more trees to bottom start location. Mercenary 
  creep camps are better suited to drop a level-4 charged item.
- (2)TheTwoRivers - Removed the Rune of Rebirth from Ogre Mage; added Rune of 
  Mana to Ogre Mage. Lowered Ogre Lord drop from permanent level-6 item to
  level-5 item. Increased level of power up.
- (2)GlacialThaw - The drop tables have been re-adjusted for better one-on-one 
  competition.
- (4)TwistedMeadows - Corner creep camps harder to Gargoyle rush. Replaced 
  Tavern with Goblin Merchant; replaced Marketplace with Tavern. Lowered creep 
  strength for Goblin Merchant. Goblin Laboratories are harder to purchase 
  from without engaging creeps.
- (4)TurtleRock - Added some trees to the south Goblin Merchant area to 
  prevent the player from making purchases from the building without engaging 
  the creeps that guard the building. Changed several creep drops to help with 
  game flow.
- (6)DemonsCrossing - Fixed alliance settings.
- (6)RiverOfSouls - Removed the creeps from the taverns and fixed a cave 
  doodad.
- (8)AzureTowerDefense - Fixed the hotkey for the Azure Wisp 'A'. Fixed a 
  spelling error with 'Upgrade Arrow Damage' tooltip. Azure Witch had a 
  conflicting ability hotkey that has been fixed. Brilliance Aura and Frost 
  Arrow both used 'R'; Brilliance Aura now uses 'A'. The +3 Tome's description 
  now correctly states that it adds +3 to all Hero attributes.

Classic - Reign of Chaos
- (2)Plunder Isle - Added some trees to the north and south location near the 
  Goblin Merchant to prevent the player from making purchases without engaging 
  the creep guarding the building. Cleared some room around the Goblin 
  Merchant to prevent Archer cheese.

  from .3 mana per hit point.
- Spell Breaker feedback damage vs. Heroes reduced to 4 per hit from 5 per 
  hit.
- Dragonhawk Rider damage reduced to 1d3 + 17 from 1d3 + 18.
- Flying Machine damage vs. air increased to 1d2 + 13 from 1d2 + 11.

  lasted 4/6/8 seconds against Heroes.

  as Crypt Fiends, instead of the same size as Abominations.

  from 125.

- Fan of Knives level-2 base damage increased to 125 from 120, and 
  level-3 base damage increased from 180 to 190. Although this appears 
  to be an upgrade, it actually is a reduction in overall power. The 
  previous patch had a bug at levels 2 and 3 in which, if 6 or more 
  targets were available, the ability did more than the expected 
  amount of maximum damage. This change remedies that error.
- Mana Flare splash damage no longer harms units that lack a mana pool.
- Wellspring now upgrades Moonwells to 425 mana, down from 500 mana, and 
  Moonwell mana regeneration scaled proportionally.

- Faerie Fire mana cost increased to 45 from 35.

Neutral Units and Heroes
- Dark Ranger starting Agility increased to 21 from 19.

  the level-2 and level-3 versions were shaped exactly like Shockwave, 
  while the level-1 area was occupying a much larger area than intended. 
  The spell now hits far fewer targets, which roughly matches the graphic.
  The damage of Breath of Fire has been increased to 65/120/175 from 
  50/100/150 to compensate for this change.

ANNOUNCEMENT

We are aware of some new issues that came up with the release of the 1.13 
patch. We will be releasing a 1.14 patch in the near future that addresses 
some of these issues, including:

- Custom save games from version 1.12 (including those from Orc Act I) 
  incorrectly recognize Hero Agility, causing slow attack speeds after the 
  1.13 patch is applied. This will be fixed in the 1.14 patch.
- Town Portal always places your units to the lower right side of your town 
  hall instead of the location you clicked, as it previously did. This will 
  be fixed in the 1.14 patch.
- If you research the Skeletal Mage upgrade, then you will no longer be able 
  to use the Raise Dead skill on the corpses inside a Meat Wagon. This will 
  be fixed in the 1.14 patch.
- When a unit with Unholy Frenzy is Polymorphed or Hexed, the unit 
  permanently loses 75% of its attack speed. This will be fixed in the 1.14 
  patch.
- If an Orc player uses the spell Spirit Link, and one of the linked units is 
  a Troll Berserker with the Berserk ability active, then all units linked 
  with that Troll will take the increased damage penalty associated with the 
  Berserk ability. This will be fixed in the 1.14 patch.
- If a unit casting a channeling spell dies from Mana Flare, the channeled
  spell lingers in the area permanently. This will be fixed in the 1.14 
  patch.
- The Call to Arms command does not work if you click the button an EVEN 
  number of times. This will be fixed in the 1.14 patch.
* Any other confirmed issues that we can fix in time for the release of the 
  1.14 patch.

Regarding balance, we are currently assessing the state of balance of 1.13 
based on user feedback, online testing, and the review of replays. Although 
we will make some number of balance changes in 1.14, these have yet to be 
determined. 

We appreciate the community's patience and support in our endeavor to further 
tune the play balance, enhance the feature set, and increase the stability 
of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.

- PATCH 1.13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES

- Acts II & III, the conclusion acts to the bonus Orc campaign contained in 
  The Frozen Throne, are included in this patch. To play these levels, you
  can simply click the "Chapter Two - Old Hatreds" link from the Bonus Campaign 
  screen. If you have completed Act I, your Heroes will carry over to Act II.
  Otherwise, your Heroes will be default-level Heroes with basic starting items.
- Warcraft III now supports binding an email address to your Battle.net account, 
  so that you can recover your password at a later stage, similar to the 
  functionality that was added to D2. 
- Race selection on the scheduled game dialog (tournament finals) is now saved 
  for future scheduled games.
  
MAPS

Expansion - Frozen Throne
- (2)Tirisfal Glades - Red creep camp a bit easier; lowered the level of item 
  drop from 7 to 5.
- (2)Glacial Thaw - Switched the start locations to face the center of the 
  map. Lowered the level of a few creep camps; lowered the level of a few 
  item drops.
- (4)Paradise Island - Creeps are less likely to aggro passing units.
- (4)Twisted Meadows - Added ground-based anti-air creep to the island. Added 
  some trees behind the 3 o'clock start location to prevent building NE town 
  hall behind the gold mine. Changed a level-4 drop from charged item to 
  permanent item. 
- (4)Bridge Too Near - Switched start locs with the expansion gold mines.
- (4)Devil's Cauldron - Lowered the total level of 4 creep camps.
- (4)Turtle Rock - The two large turtles that are placed between player bases
  each drop a better item. Removed Rune of Lesser Healing from the expansion 
  creep.
- (4)Floodplains 1v1 - Removed the easy creep camp outside of player's base 
  and moved it to the other easy creep camps further from the player's base.
- (4)Lost Temple - Adjusted creep camps and item drops.

  the center and created a bit more room around the Taverns.
- (6)Stranglethorn Vale - Expansion creeps are a bit easier now.
- (6)Timbermaw Hold - Moved the bottom Dragon Roost creep closer together to
  eliminate two creep icons. Moved bottom middle start location deeper into 
  forest to prevent the easy (green) creep camp from being nuked from start 
  location placement. Same change to the bottom left position. Added a tree to 
  the hole in the forest at the top left position to prevent units from 
  getting stuck when portaling home.
- (8)Friends - Changed drop item classification from 'any' level-6 items to 
  'charged' level-6 items.

  also added some trees to the top start location.

  creep. The Goblin Merchant camp is now tougher and has anti-air.

BALANCE CHANGES

Human
- Storm Bolt stun is now 5 seconds vs. units and 3 seconds vs. Heroes at all 
  levels. Previously, it had this level of stun at level 1, but went up 2 
  seconds vs. units and one second vs. Heroes each level. Additionally, 
  level-2 and level-3 damage are now 225 and 350, respectively.
- Militia can now only be created from a player's starting Town Hall, but they
  can still be created from any of the player's Keeps or Castles.
- Blizzard is now damage capped. This damage cap is invoked when Blizzard hits 
  more than 5 targets per wave.
- Scout Tower hp reduced to 300 from 500, and armor reduced to 0 from 5.
- Human towers now gain 2 armor per masonry upgrade, up from 1.
- Banish has been reworked. Previously durations were 12(5) / 24(7) / 36(9) 
  by level, and mana costs were 75/50/25 by level. Instead, its mana cost is 
  now constant at 75 mana; its cooldown decreases with level (5 / 3 / 1); and 
  its durations only slightly improve with level (12(4) / 15(5) / 18(6)).
- Siphon Mana maximum range reduced to 800 from 850.
- Flying Machine hit points increased to 200 from 175.
- Holy Light mana cost reduced to 65 from 75.

Undead
- Web upgrade cost increased to 150/150 from 75/75.
- Spirit Touch now restores 3 mana per casting, down from 4.
- Possession has been reworked. It is now a channelled spell with a 4 1/2 
  second casting duration. During this time, the target is disabled and
  frozen into place, but is also invulnerable; and the Banshee takes triple
  damage from all attacks. Stunning or killing the Banshee that is casting
  Possession will cause the spell to abort. Additionally, the range of
  Possession has been increased to 350 from 200.
- Anti-magic Shell has been redesigned. The spell now absorbs the first 350 
  points of spell or magic damage dealt to the target, but does not grant 
  magic immunity. Note that spells absorbed by AMS can still deal secondary 
  effects, such as stun, paralysis, or mana drain. Also the mana cost of
  AMS has been re-balanced to 150.

Orc
- Troll Batrider Unstable Concoction damage reduced to 550 from 900, and 
  splash damage increased to 140 from 100.

- Level-1 Spirit Wolves now move at speed 320, down from speed 350.
- Level-3 Spirit Wolves now have 500 hit points, up from 400 hit points.

  via Spirit Link instead reduces a unit to 1 hit point, and dispels Spirit 
  Link.
- Stasis Trap area of effect reduced to 400 from 500.
- Shockwave now has a damage cap of roughly 12 units affected. Note that this 
  limit will not typically be reached except in team games.

- Naga Sea Witch speed reduced to 300 from 320.
- Frost Arrows mana cost is now 10 per shot, up from 7 per shot.

  means that he takes up less space on the battlefield.

  Fire hits more than 5 targets per wave.

  reduced to 9-10 from 14-15.
- Cleave attack splash radius increased to 200 from 150.
- Dragonspawn Meddlers have been rebalanced to correctly reflect their food, 
  level and gold cost. They now have 370 hit points, down from 500 hit points, 
  and deal 12-13 damage, down from 21-25 damage.
- Mercenary Barbed Arachnathids are now available at the start of the second 
  day, instead of very early in the game.

  Additionally, creep Faerie Fire cooldown increased to 8 from 5.

  affect its owner's units.
- Staff of Sanctuary now heals 15 hp/sec, up from 10 hp/sec.

Other
- We have made modifications to how gold is mined. Although these changes are 
  somewhat difficult to describe, the effect is that in almost all cases, 5 
  peons are required for an Orc or Human to mine a gold mine at maximum 
  efficiency (assuming the town hall equivalent is as close as possible).

  reflect new air pathing changes.

Orcs
- Wind Walk now has a cooldown of 5 seconds, costs 75 mana at all levels

  made to prevent players from cheesing high level creep camps by using Wand
  of Illusion on high level creeps, and then using this illusionary creep to
  tank the damage.

  as fast as one.

Other
- When "attack-moving", air units now prefer to attack other air units more
  often than previously.
- Creeps that are not in combat now ignore flying units. This means that if

  up and return to their start location. 
- Goblin Sappers now deal 750 damage to buildings, 250 damage to all units,
  and 185 damage to Heroes. These values are reduced by armor values such as
  '5 armor', but do not interact with armor types (e.g. 'Medium armor').
- Units in a transport over ground will "spill out" over a wider area. This
  means that surrounding a webbed transport and killing it will generally
  not kill the passengers.

cannot be viewed with the 1.10 version of Warcraft III.) Custom save games will 
not load from version 1.07.

You can find further information related to armor and damage types on our 
web site at http://www.battle.net/war3/basics/armorandweapontypes.shtml

Spellcaster Rebalance
- Most spellcasters (Sorceress, Priest, Shaman, Witch Doctor, Necromancer, 
  Banshee, Druid of the Talon) have been re-balanced. In general, units 
  with piercing damage rip up spellcasters, while basic melee units, such 
  as Ghouls or Footmen, are weak against spellcasters. The specific 
  changes to the units in question are:
  * They have a new armor type, unarmored, which takes bonus damage from 
    siege and piercing attacks.  
  * They also have a new damage type, magic, which does reduced damage to 
    fortified and hero armor, but does bonus damage against medium armor.
  * They had their damage adjusted, typically downwards.
  * They no longer gain damage as they go up in level, and gain less 
    hitpoints as they go up in level (but start with more hitpoints when 
    initially built)
  * Many autocast buffs and debuff costs reduced.
  * Casters, including Dryads, have had their mana regeneration rates 
    boosted by 30%.

Hero Damage
- Heroes now have an aptly named hero damage type. It deals 100% damage
  to everything except fortified armor, to which it deals 50% damage. Hero 
  damage was added so that heroes no longer strongly counter ranged units 
  such as Archers and Crypt Fiends.

Advanced Structures 
- Most advanced technology structures had their build times reduced. This 
  reduction ranged from 20 seconds for especially underused structures, to 
  10 seconds for less underused structures. For instance, the Slaughterhouse 
  builds 20 seconds faster now, while the Arcane Sanctum build time was only 
  reduced 10 seconds.

- Ancients temporarily lose their fortified armor when they uproot, 
  becoming medium armor units.

  effectively.

Humans

  a fixed amount of mana per second to units under its power -- .75, 1.5,

  casters, players will find it is less powerful (though still exceedingly 
  useful) with Heroes.
- Divine Shield now costs 25 mana, down from 75.
- Blizzard no longer goes up in radius as the level of the ability increases.
- Water elementals now last 60 seconds, down from 75.

Undead
- Gargoyles' ground attack was substantially upgraded.  They now do 21-24 
  damage, up from 16-18 damage. They also have less armor (3, down from 5), 
  but also hit harder against air units, doing 51-63 damage, up from 46-57 
  damage.  Note that they are still just as effective against air units as 
  they were before, but their ground attack has been much improved.
- Death Pact now costs 50 mana (down from 75), and can be cast twice as 
  frequently as before (15 seconds cooldown from 30).
- Lich Heroes now have far more hit points, as they now have 15 str + 2/level, 
  up from 13 + 1.6/level.
- Frost Armor is now an auto-cast spell which will target units under attack 
  if auto-casting is enabled.  Frost Armor also costs less mana -- 40 down 
  from 50.
- The Spirit Tower Upgrade now costs 160/40, up from 120/40.
- Crypt Fiends' attack was slightly improved.

Orcs
- Headhunters have more hit points (350, up from 280), but also strike more 
  slowly.
- Stasis Trap no longer stuns friendly units, but has a shorter duration 
  (6 seconds, down from 12 seconds).  Stasis Traps, when they are set off,
  also destroy other Stasis Traps within their area of effect.
- Kodo Beasts now have 1000 hit points, up from 790 hit points.  They also 
  attack more slowly than before.
- Orc Barracks cost less lumber: 50, down from 70.
- Watch Towers now do 16-18 damage, down from 19-22 damage.
- Grunts now have 700 hit points, up 20 from 680.
- Shaman's attack is far less powerful.  They attack somewhat more slowly, 
  and also do 11-12 damage, down from 14-16 damage.
- Stasis Ward and Sentry Ward no longer inhibit movement or building 
  construction.

Night Elves
- Sentinel can now be removed from a tree with various dispels (Wand of 
  Negation, Dryads, etc.), as well by attacking the tree with a peon or siege 
  unit (previously, the tree had to be destroyed -- now it merely has to be 
  damaged).
- Mana Burn no longer affects units with Mana Burn (Demon Hunters, Satyr 
  Soulstealers, Felhounds, etc.).
- Thorns is now a %-based ability that reflects 10%, 20% or 30% of melee 
  damage dealt by level.
- Wisp's sight radius increased by 25%.
- Detonate now does 225 damage against summoned creatures, up from 150.

- Treants now last 60 seconds, down from 75 seconds.
- Eating trees now gives a constant, non-stacking healing effect for 10 
  seconds.
- Moon Wells now spend mana on health and mana replenishment separately. For 
  instance, if you sent a 0-mana, nearly dead Demon Hunter to a Moon Well, 
  and the Moon Well had 100 mana, your DH would gain 25 mana, and 100 health. 
  Before, the Hero would gain 200 health and 50 mana. This change does not 
  affect the benefits of healing a unit without mana.

Creeps
- All melee creeps in between levels 1 and 5 are slightly more powerful.
- All creeps of level 6 or higher now have Hero magic resistance.
- Creeps of level 7 or higher will behave more intelligently in general.
- All creeps of level 7 or higher now deal Chaos damage.
- Level 10 Dragons no longer have spell immunity.
- Many minor creep balance tweaks to damage and abilities.
- Mercenaries are now more accurately priced in general, which in most 
  cases amounts to price decreases.

- Tome of Power, Mask of Death both increased in level (8 to 9 and 8 to 10 
  respectively).
- Wand of Lightning Shield is now a level-3 item, down from level 6.
